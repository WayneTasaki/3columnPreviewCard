## About This Project

<p>This challenge is perfect if you're just getting started. The shift between the layouts will be a nice test if you're new to building responsive projects.
The challenge is to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
